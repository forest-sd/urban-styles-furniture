<p>A good mattress is one of the most important purchases you'll ever make. It affects your sleep quality, your energy, your mood, your back health, and your overall well-being. Yet most people spend more time researching their next phone than their next mattress. Let's change that.</p>

<h2>Types of Mattresses</h2>
<p>Understanding the main types helps you narrow down your options quickly:</p>

<h3>Innerspring</h3>
<p>The traditional choice. Innerspring mattresses use steel coils for support, topped with layers of padding and fabric. They offer good airflow (sleep cooler), responsive bounce, and firm edge support. Modern innerspring mattresses use individually wrapped coils that reduce motion transfer — a big improvement over older designs.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who prefer a traditional feel, back and stomach sleepers, hot sleepers, and those who like a firmer surface.</p>

<h3>Memory Foam</h3>
<p>Memory foam contours to your body shape, providing personalized pressure relief. It's excellent at reducing pressure points on hips, shoulders, and joints. Higher-density foams last longer and provide better support, but can feel warmer than other types.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Side sleepers, people with joint pain, couples (excellent motion isolation), and anyone who likes a "hugging" feel.</p>

<h3>Hybrid</h3>
<p>Hybrids combine an innerspring coil base with memory foam or latex comfort layers on top. You get the support and bounce of coils with the pressure relief and contouring of foam. They tend to sleep cooler than all-foam mattresses while offering better motion isolation than traditional innerspring.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want the best of both worlds, combination sleepers (move between positions), and couples with different preferences.</p>

<h3>Latex</h3>
<p>Natural latex (from rubber trees) or synthetic latex provides a responsive, bouncy feel that's different from memory foam. Latex doesn't "sink in" the way memory foam does — it pushes back. It's durable, naturally hypoallergenic, and sleeps cooler than foam.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Eco-conscious buyers, people who find memory foam too hot or too slow to respond, and those with allergies.</p>

<h2>How to Choose Your Firmness</h2>
<p>Firmness is the most personal aspect of mattress selection. Here's a general guide based on sleep position:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Side sleepers:</strong> Soft to medium — you need cushioning for your shoulders and hips, which bear the most pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Back sleepers:</strong> Medium to medium-firm — support for your spine's natural curve while cushioning your lower back.</li>
<li><strong>Stomach sleepers:</strong> Medium-firm to firm — prevents your hips from sinking too far, which causes lower back strain.</li>
<li><strong>Combination sleepers:</strong> Medium — the most versatile firmness that works across multiple positions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Body weight matters too:</strong> Lighter people (under 130 lbs) generally prefer softer mattresses, while heavier individuals (over 230 lbs) often need firmer options for adequate support.</p>

<h2>Size Guide</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Twin (38" × 75"):</strong> Children, teens, or very small rooms.</li>
<li><strong>Twin XL (38" × 80"):</strong> Taller teens, college dorms, adjustable bed frames.</li>
<li><strong>Full/Double (54" × 75"):</strong> Single adults, guest rooms, smaller bedrooms.</li>
<li><strong>Queen (60" × 80"):</strong> The most popular size — fits most bedrooms and works for couples.</li>
<li><strong>King (76" × 80"):</strong> Maximum space for couples, great for master bedrooms.</li>
<li><strong>Cal King (72" × 84"):</strong> Extra length for tall individuals (over 6'2").</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Long Should a Mattress Last?</h2>
<p>A quality mattress should last 7–10 years. Signs it's time to replace:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visible sagging or body impressions deeper than 1.5 inches</li>
<li>You wake up with aches and pains that go away during the day</li>
<li>You sleep better in hotels or at other people's homes</li>
<li>The mattress is over 8 years old and you notice declining comfort</li>
<li>Allergies are worsening (old mattresses accumulate dust mites)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shopping Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test in person:</strong> Spend at least 15 minutes lying on a mattress in your typical sleep position. Online reviews help, but nothing replaces the in-person test.</li>
<li><strong>Wear comfortable clothes:</strong> Don't try to evaluate a mattress in jeans and dress shoes.</li>
<li><strong>Bring your partner:</strong> If you share a bed, both of you need to be comfortable.</li>
<li><strong>Ask about trial periods:</strong> Many quality mattresses come with sleep trial periods so you can test at home.</li>
<li><strong>Don't forget the foundation:</strong> A mattress is only as good as what it sits on. Make sure your bed frame or foundation provides proper support.</li>
</ul>
