<p>Quality furniture is an investment that should last for years — sometimes decades. But even the best pieces need proper care to maintain their beauty and function. Here's our comprehensive guide to caring for every type of furniture in your home.</p>

<h2>Wood Furniture Care</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dust regularly:</strong> Use a soft, dry cloth or microfiber duster. Dusting prevents buildup that can scratch finishes over time.</li>
<li><strong>Clean gently:</strong> For deeper cleaning, use a slightly damp cloth followed immediately by a dry cloth. Never leave water sitting on wood surfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid direct sunlight:</strong> UV rays fade and dry out wood finishes. Use curtains or blinds in rooms with strong sun exposure, or rotate decorative items periodically to ensure even aging.</li>
<li><strong>Use coasters and placemats:</strong> Water rings and heat marks are preventable. Always use coasters for beverages and trivets for hot dishes.</li>
<li><strong>Polish occasionally:</strong> Use a quality furniture polish or wax 2–4 times per year to nourish the wood and maintain its luster. Avoid silicone-based polishes that can build up over time.</li>
<li><strong>Handle humidity:</strong> Wood expands and contracts with humidity changes. Try to maintain consistent indoor humidity (40–60%) to prevent cracking and warping.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Leather Furniture Care</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dust and vacuum:</strong> Wipe leather weekly with a dry cloth. Vacuum crevices monthly to remove crumbs and debris.</li>
<li><strong>Condition regularly:</strong> Apply a leather conditioner every 6–12 months to prevent drying and cracking. This is the single most important thing you can do for leather furniture.</li>
<li><strong>Clean spills immediately:</strong> Blot (don't rub) spills with a clean, dry cloth. For stubborn stains, use a leather-specific cleaner — never household cleaners, which can damage the finish.</li>
<li><strong>Keep away from heat:</strong> Don't place leather furniture near radiators, fireplaces, or heating vents. Heat dries leather out faster than anything.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace the patina:</strong> Quality leather develops a beautiful patina over time. This is a feature, not a flaw — it's what makes real leather special.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fabric Upholstery Care</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vacuum weekly:</strong> Use the upholstery attachment to remove dust, pet hair, and crumbs from cushions and crevices.</li>
<li><strong>Rotate and flip cushions:</strong> If your cushions are reversible, flip and rotate them monthly to distribute wear evenly.</li>
<li><strong>Treat stains quickly:</strong> Blot stains immediately with a clean cloth. Check the care tag (W = water-based cleaner, S = solvent-based, WS = either, X = professional only).</li>
<li><strong>Professional cleaning:</strong> Have upholstered furniture professionally cleaned every 1–2 years, especially if you have kids or pets.</li>
<li><strong>Protect from sun:</strong> Fabric fades in direct sunlight. Rotate your furniture periodically or use window treatments to protect colors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mattress Care</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a mattress protector:</strong> This is non-negotiable. A waterproof, breathable protector prevents stains, dust mites, and allergens from reaching your mattress.</li>
<li><strong>Rotate every 3–6 months:</strong> Rotate your mattress 180 degrees to promote even wear. Most modern mattresses don't need flipping (they're designed with a specific top and bottom).</li>
<li><strong>Don't jump on it:</strong> Excessive force can damage springs and foam layers. This goes for kids too.</li>
<li><strong>Let it breathe:</strong> When changing sheets, leave the mattress uncovered for 30 minutes to let moisture evaporate.</li>
<li><strong>Proper support:</strong> Ensure your bed frame or foundation provides adequate support. A sagging foundation will ruin even the best mattress.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Follow manufacturer instructions:</strong> Always check care tags and warranty documentation for specific guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Lift, don't drag:</strong> When moving furniture, lift it to avoid damaging legs, feet, and floor surfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Use felt pads:</strong> Place felt pads under furniture legs to prevent scratches on hardwood and tile floors.</li>
<li><strong>Address issues early:</strong> A loose screw, wobbly leg, or small tear only gets worse with time. Fix small problems before they become big ones.</li>
</ul>
